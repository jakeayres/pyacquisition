st.write('Welcome to the PyAcquisition documentation! PyAcquisition is a Python package designed to facilitate seamless interfacing with measurement hardware for performing scientific measurements. This guide will help you get started and explore its capabilities.')

st.write('''A modest level of proficiency with `Python` is presumed. `PyAcquisition` is not a program that is simply executed, but a python package 
	that facilitates the rapid assembly of your own measurement software. Importing it into your python project will allow you to interface with
	instruments, collect, record and visualize live data by writing only a handful of lines of code. If you are not familiar with concepts such 
	as class inheretence, do not fear. Following the "Getting Started" walk-through will explain how to use the core functionality of 
	`PyAcquisition` in accessible terms.''')

st.header('Contributing')

st.write('''We are very happy to review contributions to the `PyAcquisition` codebase. Widening the number of supported instruments, for example,
	is hugely appreciated. Detailed descriptions of how `PyAcquisition` operates are available **here**.''')
