An experiment is setup either by inhereting from `pyacquisition.experiment` and composing an appropriate `setup()` method or by instantiating the experiment using `Experiment.from_config()` and passing a `.toml` file within which all of your experiment's functionality is defined. Both are possible, but in most cases, composing a `.toml` is the simplest option. At the end of the day, the `.toml` file is read and various public methods are called. Calling these public methods yourself within `setup()` is functionally equivalent.
